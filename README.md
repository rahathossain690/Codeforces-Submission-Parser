# Codeforces-Submission-Parser
Parses submission for given contestIds and Handles of Codeforces and stores them in CSV format
# How to use
1. Write contestIds of codeforces on the file 'contestIds.txt' separating them by a whitespace.
2. Write handles of codeforces on the file 'handles.txt' separating them by a whitespace.
3. Run the command and wait. The Codeforces.csv will have the CSV formated data.
```
python Parse.py
```
4. To read data primarily use this command. Or use the CSVReader.py for further works (by modifying).
```
python CSVReader.py
```
That's it.
